**An open-source exploration into using computer vision to identify potential iron ore deposits in my home region of Kabale, Western Uganda.**

### üå± The Spark

The story of this project started with these rocks right here. With the growing momentum around developing the iron ore industry in my home region, I became fascinated by a simple question: can modern AI help us understand our own land better? Instead of just talking about it, I went out and got my first data points. This project is my journey to answer that question, and I'm building it entirely in the open.

### üí° The Idea

My goal is to build **Kigezi OreSight**, a deep learning system that will learn to analyze publicly available satellite imagery and create a predictive heat map of potential iron ore deposits. By training a model to recognize the unique patterns of mineral-rich land, I hope to create an open-source tool that can help guide and de-risk initial exploration efforts for our local community. This isn't about creating a commercial product; it's about exploring the art of the possible and sharing the knowledge with everyone.

### ‚ú® The Vision for the Live Demo

The ultimate deliverable will be a simple, interactive web application. Imagine this: you'll be able to select an area on a map of Kabale, and the AI model will overlay a beautiful heatmap in real-time.

![A user selects a region on a map, and a dynamic, animated red/yellow heatmap appears over the satellite image, with Koko the Pangolin pointing to the areas of highest probability.](https://placehold.co/800x450/343A40/FFFFFF?text=Live+Demo+Animation+Vision)

*(This will be a screen recording of the final Streamlit application.)*

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Will Work: The Technical Journey

1.  **Data Collection:** I will gather multispectral satellite images from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite via the Sentinel Hub API.
2.  **Data Labeling:** I'll use existing geological survey maps of the Kigezi region to create labeled training data, marking areas of known iron ore presence.
3.  **Model Training:** A custom U-Net segmentation model, built with **PyTorch**, will be trained on this labeled data. The model will learn to segment any given satellite image into areas of high, medium, and low probability for iron ore deposits.
4.  **Inference & API:** The trained model will be served via a lightweight **FastAPI** application, which will expose an endpoint to process new satellite images.
5.  **Visualization:** A simple web interface built with **Streamlit** will allow users to interact with the model, select an area, and view the resulting heat map visualization.
